## Introduction
This project consists in a data analysis of the immigration (its characteristics and consequences) in the city of Barcelona, from 1997 to 2025, using different open data sources (specified in the following section). The project is divided in five subprojects, each one corresponding to one of the contributors, which have the objective of analysing different specific aspects of the studied topic.

### Data storage
All the data corresponding to the original data sets can be found in a google drive folder (https://drive.google.com/drive/u/1/folders/1RcMc1dbqj3XbPj8vlShsVeRvFjJF8vma) 

## Requirements

### Python environment
The environment used in this project can be found on the GitHub repository of the course on Analysis and Visualization of Big Data from the University of Barcelona (https://github.com/jvicens/analysis-and-visualization-of-big-data-course). 

Here is a quick installation using conda (and pip for unavailable packages) aimed towards working on VSCode:
```console
conda create --name ub-avbd python=3.12
conda activate ub-avbd
conda config --add channels conda-forge
conda install --file requirements.txt
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

Any extra packages required in specific codes will be explained in their respective directories.

### Uncode and reformat data
Most data from Ajuntament de Barcelona is coded, for example for *Sexe* we have 1 and 2 instead of female and male, although a *.csv* file with all the coded values is also provided. Furthermore, some datasets have an inconsistent column names.

To solve this issues, the code *./Ale/0_reformat_data.ipynb* loads the data located at the main directory of the repository *./data_original/* and generates a new folder on the same level *./data/* which will be used in all of our jupyter notebooks, so it **must be run first**. Unmodified files are also cloned to this new folder for better organization as they are fairly light.

## Code execution

### Alba directory

### Ale directory
There are two jupyter notebooks in this directory: 

- *0_reformat_data.ipynb*, which is required to run most of the codes in this repository and was explained in section **Data translation**.
- *1_density_and_diversity.ipynb*, a code to generate several plots that give an overview of the immigration situation in Barcelona, which acts as a motivation for our project while giving rise to some initial results.


The latter can only be run after the first notebook since it works with datasets [1] and [2], which have coded values. It also requires an **additional Python library (Generativepy)** that cannot be installed through conda, so we used pip:

```console
conda activate ub-avbd
pip install generativepy
```

The code will **generate a folder *./Ale/img/* with the final plots** of this study:

1. **Density Comparison**: 2x2 axes containing (1997 and 2025) x (Total and Immigrant population densities) per neighborhood density colormaps with a single legend (colorbar) added as an extra axis, which has a logarithmic scale.
2. **Dominant Group x Share**: bivariate colormap that reveals the most present immigrant group on each neighborhood in 2025 and the share it represents among immigrants.
3. **Diversity Comparison**: 1x2 axes with colormaps of the total and immigrant diversities in 2025 resulting from the normalized Shannon Entropy indicator. The plot displays a single legend (colorbar) added as an extra axis.
4. **Diversity Interpretation**: horizontal bars for three relevant neighborhoods that display high, medium and low diversity in 2025 (on the resulting spectrum). They illustrate the relevance of different population groups for each normalized Shannon Entropy. This gives an idea on how to interpret this diversity index, which is not an intuitive quantity.


Although **not implemented** since we did not need to create files for this project, the treated **data** used for all plots **can be easily computed and exported to *.csv* files** (or any desired format) with two functions created.

- `data_density(year)`: generates one of the DataFrames used in figure (1), which has all the information for the specified year.

    | Field | Description |
    | ----- | ----------- |
    | District  | District name |
    | Neighborhood | Neighborhood name |
    | Geometry_etrs89 | Geometry of the neighborhood in etrs89 format |
    | Population_Spain | Spanish population in the neighborhood |
    | Population_outside_Spain | Immigrant population in the neighborhood |
    | Total_Population | Spanish + Immigrant population in the neighborhood |
    | Immigrant_percentage | Percentage of immigrants with respect to the total population in the neighborhood |
    | Area_km2 | Area in square kilometers of the neighborhood |
    | Population_density | Total population in a neighborhood divided by its area |
    | Immigrant_density | Immigrant population in a neighborhood divided by its area |

- `data_diversity(year)`: generates the DataFrame used in figures (2), (3) and (4), which has all the information for the desired year.

    | Field | Description |
    | ----- | ----------- |
    | District  | District name |
    | Neighborhood | Neighborhood name |
    | <Group> | Immigration group's population in the neighborhood after rearranging original regions into a smaller set |
    | Spain | Spanish population in the neighborhood |
    | Total_Immigrants | Immigrant population in the neighborhood |
    | Total_Population | Spanish + Immigrant population in the neighborhood |
    | \<Group>_share | Population of the group divided by the immigrant population, both in the neighborhood |
    | \<Group>_total_share | Population of the group divided by the total population, both in the neighborhood |
    | Dominant_Group | Name of the biggest immigrant group in the neighborhood |
    | Dominant_Group_Value | Population of the biggest immigrant group in the neighborhood |
    | Dominant_Group_share | Population of the biggest immigrant group divided by the immigrant population, both in the neighborhood |
    | Dominant_Group_total_share | Population of the biggest immigrant group divided by the total population, both in the neighborhood |
    | Diversity | Shannon Entropy (diversity indicator) computed over the immigrant population groups in the neighborhood |
    | Diversity_Norm | Shannon Entropy normalized by dividing over the logarithm of the number of immigrant groups considered |
    | Diversity_Total | Shannon Entropy (diversity indicator) computed over the total population in the neighborhood |
    | Diversity_Total_Norm | Shannon Entropy normalized by dividing over the logarithm of the number of immigrant groups considered + 1 for the Spanish population |


Both functions return a DataFrame that can be exported as a *.csv*. Here is an **example** on how to use them:

    df = data_density(2025)
    df.to_csv('<directory>/<filename>.csv', index=False)

where <...> has to be substituted with the desired output.


### Pablo directory

### Sara directory
This directory contains all the codes used in the creation of the mini article "Assessing the Socioeconomic and Educational Effects of Immigration in Barcelona".  It consist of four .ipynb files: 0_data_process.ipynb does a first cleaning and process of the datasets that are going to be used (3,4 and 5) in the creation of the different figures, saving them in a folder (local) called "generated_data"; and the other three correspond to the generation of the figures themselves, that we are going to discuss next. Two other folders (local) are added to Sara directory: one with the name "outputs", to save the results of the plots; and other named "images", where the files legend1.png and legend2.png have to be saved for them to be used as a legend in the bubble chart. These can be found in the link to the repository's drive.

We used the following generated data frames in each plot:

1. **1_bubble_chart.ipynb: correlation between socioeconomic indices and education in the different neighborhoods of Barcelona**

### Sergi Directory
This directory contains a single .ipynb file which creates all the figures necessary for the "Is the immigration in Barcelona the cause of the Spain-born citizens’ emigration?" mini article. The csv files containing the data generated are stored in the data folder (local), with a folder name "sergi_data_frames". Apart from that, another folder (local) is created inside the Sergi directory called "figures_sergi" containing all the generated figures in .png and .pdf format. The data sets used are 1, 2 and 6.
