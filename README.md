### Data translation

### Where to store the data locally

## Code execution

### Alba directory

### Ale directory

### Pablo directory

### Sara directory
This directory contains all the codes used in the creation of the mini article "Assessing the Socioeconomic and Educational Effects of Immigration in Barcelona".  It consist of four .ipynb files: 0_data_process.ipynb does a first cleaning and process of the datasets that are going to be used (3,4 and 5) in the creation of the different figures, saving them in a folder (local) called "generated_data"; and the other three correspond to the generation of the figures themselves, that we are going to discuss next. Two other folders (local) are added to Sara directory: one with the name "outputs", to save the results of the plots; and other named "images", where the files legend1.png and legend2.png have to be saved for them to be used as a legend in the bubble chart. These can be found in the link to the repository's drive.

We used the following generated data frames in each plot:

1. **1_bubble_chart.ipynb: correlation between socioeconomic indices and education in the different neighborhoods of Barcelona**

### Sergi Directory
This directory contains a single .ipynb file which creates all the figures necessary for the "Is the immigration in Barcelona the cause of the Spain-born citizens’ emigration?" mini article. The csv files containing the data generated are stored in the data folder (local), with a folder name "sergi_data_frames". Apart from that, another folder (local) is created inside the Sergi directory called "figures_sergi" containing all the generated figures in .png and .pdf format. The data sets used are 1, 2 and 6.
